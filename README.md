### Overall power subsystem
This module will be responsible for powering the entire system.

 The Micro-Mouse Project involves designing a power subsystem that will be used in the development of a micro-mouse robot. 
 The greater project is made of the motherboard, the processor, power and sensor modules. The mother board, processor and the sensor modules have already been designed
 and manufactured. 
 
 The task at hand is to design and manufacture the power module to integrate with the overall micro-mouse system.
